
Akka-esb Vision
---------------
To create a service bus that facilitates the creation of highly-decoupled (temporal, platform & implementation) business 
services that can scale horizontally and are highly-resilient to faults.


Features
----------------------
+ Highly fault-tolerant - as soon as business intent is captured, it should never be lost. e.g. at least once message delivery
+ Enables horizontal scalability (as much as it can)
+ Easily monitorable (performance of system, errors)
+ Primarily to run on linux
+ Can be used in any programming language


Motivations
-----------
+ Want to learn more about building distributed systems and middleware
+ Want to improve my scala and akka skills
+ Need a service bus similar to NServiceBus that works on linux and for any language, for my future projects


Development Philosohpy
----------------------
+ It should be easy for other devs to understand the project at a high-level very quickly so they can get involved
+ All errors should be as informative as possible - OS dependencies through to bad coding logic
+ Strong bias in favour of testing - end-to-end and unit where possible
