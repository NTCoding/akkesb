----

1. Some way to automate running of all multi jvm tests

2. Maybe create a diagram showing actor system?

5. Create some tests that simulate failures in the actor system
	+ e.g. what if the actor that receives commands dies?

6. Set up a schedule for code-review and clean up
	+ think about how to use akka better
	+ make code more functional

7. Code review
	+ standardise things
	+ consistent message naming pattern
	+ consistent testing style
