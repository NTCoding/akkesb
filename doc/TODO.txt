----

1. Find out why multi-jvm tests don't run unless the full name is specified

2. Maybe create a diagram showing actor system?

3. Update readme
	+ point people to the design diagrams
	+ list all dependencies that need to be installed
	+ mention there will be a sample application coming soon

4. Investigate why intellij is so out of sync with sbt (sbt works when intellij doesn't)

5. Create some tests that simulate failures in the actor system
	+ e.g. what if the actor that receives commands dies?
