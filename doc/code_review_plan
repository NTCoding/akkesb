Code review Plan
----------------

Things to look at:
	
	1. Flow of messages through the system.
		Currently there is a lot of asynchronous request/response. Would it make sense 			to have a sequential pipeline that messages flow through?

	2. Naming of things - including tests.
		+ some actors are suffixed with actor
		+ some tests are suffixed with test, whilst others are suffixed with spec

	3. Folder structure
		+ how am I going to group messages - by protocol?
		+ folder per-feature?


General considerations:

	1. Try not to refactor things that change how the system works - only do this if there 		is an actual benefit to doing it - not just because it is a best practice. If there is 		some benefit to be had - try and write a test around it.
