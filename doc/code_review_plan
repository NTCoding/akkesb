Code review Plan
----------------

Things to look at:
	
	1. Flow of messages through the system.
		Currently there is a lot of asynchronous request/response. Would it make sense to have a sequential pipeline that messages flow through?

	2. Naming of things - including tests.
		+ some actors are suffixed with actor
		+ some tests are suffixed with test, whilst others are suffixed with spec

	3. Folder structure
		+ how am I going to group messages - by protocol?
		+ folder per-feature?

	4. Testing - am I testing the implementation details by checking that every message is sent to every actor?
		+ should I just say that when these actors are filled with this state lined up in this order?

	5. Create some diagrams showing message flow through the system?


General considerations:

	1. Try not to refactor things that change how the system works - only do this if there is an actual benefit to doing it - not just because it is a best practice. If there is some benefit to be had - try and write a test around it.
