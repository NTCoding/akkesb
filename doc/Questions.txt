
Outstanding Questions
---------------------

1. How will the bus host application be started?

2. What will the message format be?

3. How will instances of the host join the bus's network?

4. How will a message consumer receive messages so it can process them?

5. How will hosts share configuration/registration details?

6. How will the running system update configuration/registration details as hosts are added / updated / removed?

7. If queues live on same OS / machine as service, how can the services be scaled?

8. How will the system handle hardware failures - what will happen to messages in all of the queues? They need to be saved (probably)

9. Should there be an error queue for each service or one centralised error queue (with availability levels as required)?.

10. If the client is to be push based (somehow, e.g. ports) would it be possible to just hook into rabbitmq and let it do the work?

11. should there be 1 host process machine or 1 host process per service? - Spend time thinking about this and looking at how other buses work
